<h1 align="center"><a name="Chap_1"></a><b>Chapter One</b></h1>
<a id="p14" name="p14"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(14)">"Talk to me, John!"</p>
<a id="p15" name="p15"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(15)">Rear Admiral Michelle Henke's husky contralto came sharp and crisp as the information on her repeater tactical display shifted catastrophically.</p>
<a id="p16" name="p16"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(16)">"It's still coming in from the Flag, Ma'am," Commander Oliver Manfredi, Battlecruiser Squadron Eighty-One's golden-haired chief of staff, replied for the squadron's operations officer, Lieutenant Commander John Stackpole. Manfredi was standing behind Stackpole, watching the ops section's more detailed displays, and he had considerably more attention to spare for updates at the moment than Stackpole did. "I'm not sure, but it looks&mdash;"</p>
<a id="p17" name="p17"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(17)">Manfredi broke off, and his jaw clenched. Then his nostrils flared and he squeezed Stackpole's shoulder before he turned his head to look at his admiral.</p>
<a id="p18" name="p18"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(18)">"It would appear the Peeps have taken Her Grace's lessons to heart, Ma'am," he said grimly. "They've arranged a Sidemore all their own for us."</p>
<a id="p19" name="p19"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(19)">Michelle looked at him for a moment, and her expression tightened.</p>
<a id="p20" name="p20"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(20)">"Oliver's right, Ma'am," Stackpole said, looking up from his own display as the changing light codes finally restabilized. "They've got us boxed."</p>
<a id="p21" name="p21"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(21)">"How bad is it?" she asked.</p>
<a id="p22" name="p22"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(22)">"They've sent in three separate groups," Stackpole replied. "One dead astern of us, one at polar north, and one at polar south. The Flag is designating the in-system force we already knew about as Bogey One. The task group to system north is Bogey Two; the one to system south is Bogey Three; and the one directly astern is Bogey Four. Our velocity relative to Bogey Four is just over twenty-two thousand kilometers per second, but range is less than thirty-one million klicks."</p>
<a id="p23" name="p23"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(23)">"Understood."</p>
<a id="p24" name="p24"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(24)">Michelle looked back at her own, smaller, display. At the moment, it was configured to show the entire Solon System, which meant, by definition, that it was nowhere as detailed as Stackpole's. There wasn't room for that on a plot small enough to deploy from a command chair&mdash;not when it was displaying the volume of something the size of a star system, at any rate. But it was more than detailed enough to confirm what Stackpole had just told her. The Peeps had just duplicated exactly what had happened to <i>them</i> at the Battle of Sidemore, and managed to do it on a more sophisticated scale, to boot. Unless something reduced Task Force Eighty-Two's rate of acceleration, none of the three forces which had just dropped out of hyper-space to ambush it could hope to overtake it. Unfortunately, they didn't need to physically overtake the task force in order to engage it&mdash;not when current-generation Havenite multidrive missiles had a maximum powered range from rest of over sixty million kilometers.</p>
<a id="p25" name="p25"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(25)">And, of course, there was always the possibility that there was yet <i>another </i>Havenite task group waiting in hyper, prepared to drop back into normal space right in their faces as they approached the system hyper limit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<a id="p26" name="p26"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(26)"><i>No,</i> she decided after a moment. <i>If they had the hulls for a fourth force, it would have already translated in, as well. They'd </i>really<i> have us in a rat trap if they'd been able to box us from four directions. I suppose it's possible that they </i>do <i>have another force in reserve&mdash;that they decided to double-think us and hold number four until they've had a chance to see which way we run. But that'd be a violation of the KISS principle, and this generation of Peeps doesn't go in much for that sort of thing, damn it</i>.</p>
<a id="p27" name="p27"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(27)">She grimaced at the thought, but it was certainly true.</p>
<a id="p28" name="p28"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(28)"><i>Honor's been warning us all that </i>these <i>Peeps aren't exactly stupid</i>, she reflected. <i>Not that any of us should've needed reminding after what they did to us in Thunderbolt! But I could wish that just this once she'd been wrong</i>.</p>
<a id="p29" name="p29"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(29)">Her lips twitched in a humorless smile, but she felt herself coming back on balance mentally, and her brain whirred as tactical possibilities and decision trees spilled through it. Not that the primary responsibility was hers. No, that weight rested on the shoulders of her best friend, and despite herself, Michelle was grateful that it <i>wasn't </i>hers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a fact which made her feel more than a little guilty.</p>
<a id="p30" name="p30"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(30)">One thing was painfully evident. Eighth Fleet's entire operational strategy for the last three and a half months had been dedicated to convincing the numerically superior navy of the Republic of Haven to redeploy, adopt a more defensive stance while the desperately off-balance Manticoran Alliance got its own feet back under it. Judging by the ambush into which the task force had sailed, that strategy was obviously succeeding. In fact, it looked like it was succeeding entirely too well.</p>
<a id="p31" name="p31"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(31)"><i>It was so much easier when we could keep their command teams pruned back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or count on State Security to do it for us. Unfortunately, Saint-Just's not around anymore to shoot any admiral whose initiative might make her dangerous to the r&eacute;gime, is he? </i>Her lips twitched with bitterly sardonic amusement as she recalled<i> </i>the relief with which Manticore's pundits, as well as the woman in the street, had greeted the news of the Committee of Public Safety's final overthrow.<i> Maybe we were just a little premature about that, </i>she thought<i>, since it means that this time around, we don't have anywhere near the same edge in operational experience, and it shows. </i>This <i>batch of Peeps actually knows what it's doing. Damn it</i>.</p>
<a id="p32" name="p32"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(32)">"Course change from the Flag, Ma'am," Lieutenant Commander Braga, her staff astrogator announced. "Two-niner-three, zero-zero-five, six-point-zero-one KPS squared."</p>
<a id="p33" name="p33"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(33)">"Understood," Michelle repeated, and nodded approvingly as the new vector projection stretched itself across her plot and she recognized Honor's intention. The task force was breaking to system south at its maximum acceleration on a course that would take it as far away from Bogey Two as possible while maintaining at least the current separation from Bogey Four. Their new course would still take them deep into the missile envelope of Bogey One, the detachment covering the planet Arthur, whose orbital infrastructure had been the task force's original target. But Bogey One consisted of only two superdreadnoughts and seven battlecruisers, supported by less than two hundred LACs, and from their emissions signatures and maneuvers, Bogey One's wallers were pre-pod designs. Compared to the six obviously modern superdreadnoughts and two LAC carriers in each of the three ambush forces, Bogey One's threat was minimal. Even if all nine of its hyper-capable combatants had heavy pod loads on tow, its older ships would lack the fire control to pose a significant threat to Task Force Eighty-Two's missile defenses. Under the circumstances, it was the same option Michelle would have chosen if she'd been in Honor's shoes.</p>
<a id="p34" name="p34"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(34)"><i>I wonder if they've been able to ID her flagship?</i> Michelle wondered. <i>It wouldn't have been all that hard, given the news coverage and her "negotiations" in Hera</i>. </p>
<a id="p35" name="p35"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(35)">That, too, of course, had been part of the strategy. Putting Admiral Lady Dame Honor Harrington, Duchess and Steadholder Harrington, in command of Eighth Fleet had been a carefully calculated decision on the Admiralty's part. In Michelle's opinion, Honor was obviously the best person for the command anyway, but the appointment had been made in a glare of publicity for the express purpose of letting the Republic of Haven know that "the Salamander" was the person who'd been chosen to systematically demolish its rear-area industry.</p>
<a id="p36" name="p36"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(36)"><i>One way to make sure they honored the threat</i>, Michelle thought wryly as the task force came to its new heading in obedience to the commands emanating from HMS <i>Imperator</i>, Honor's SD(P) flagship. <i>After all, she's been their personal nightmare ever since Basilisk station! But I wonder if they got a fingerprint on </i>Imperator <i>at Hera or Augusta? Probably&mdash;they knew which ship she was aboard at Hera, at least. Which probably means they know who it is they've just mousetrapped, too</i>.</p>
<a id="p37" name="p37"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(37)">Michelle grimaced at the thought. It was unlikely any Havenite flag officer would have required extra incentive to trash the task force if she could, especially after Eighth Fleet's unbroken string of victories. But knowing whose command they were about to hammer certainly couldn't make them any <i>less </i>eager to drive home their attack.</p>
<a id="p38" name="p38"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(38)">"Missile defense Plan Romeo, Ma'am," Stackpole said. "Formation Charlie."</p>
<a id="p39" name="p39"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(39)">"Defense only?" Michelle asked. "No orders to roll pods?"</p>
<a id="p40" name="p40"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(40)">"No, Ma'am. Not yet."</p>
<a id="p41" name="p41"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(41)">"Thank you."</p>
<a id="p42" name="p42"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(42)">Michelle's frown deepened thoughtfully. Her own battlecruisers' pods were loaded with Mark 16 dual-drive missiles. That gave her far more missiles per pod, but Mark 16s were both smaller, with lighter laser heads, and shorter-legged than a ship of the wall's multidrive missiles like the Mark 23s aboard Honor's superdreadnoughts. They would have been forced to adopt an attack profile with a lengthy ballistic flight, and the biggest tactical weakness of a pod battlecruiser design was that it simply couldn't carry as many pods as a true capital ship like<i> Imperator</i>. It made sense not to waste BCS 81's limited ammunition supply at a range so extended as to guarantee a low percentage of hits, but in Honor's place, Michelle would have been sorely tempted to throw at least a few salvos of all-up MDMs from her two superdreadnoughts back into Bogey Four's face, if only to keep them honest. On the other hand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<a id="p43" name="p43"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(43)"><i>Well, she's the four-star admiral, not me. And I suppose</i>&mdash;she smiled again at the tartness of her own mental tone&mdash;<i>that she's demonstrated at least a </i>modicum <i>of tactical insight from time to time</i>.</p>
<a id="p44" name="p44"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(44)">"Missile separation!" Stackpole announced suddenly. "Multiple missile separations! Estimate eleven hundred&mdash;one-one-zero-zero&mdash;inbound. Time to attack range seven minutes!"</p>
<a id="p45" name="p45"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(45)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p46" name="p46"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(46)">Each of the six Havenite superdreadnoughts in the group which had been designated Bogey Four could roll six pods simultaneously, one pattern every twelve seconds, and each pod contained ten missiles. Given the fact that Havenite fire control systems remained inferior to Manticoran ones, accuracy was going to be poor, to say the least. Which was why the admiral commanding that group had opted to stack six full patterns from each superdreadnought, programmed for staggered launch to bring all of their missiles simultaneously in on their targets. It took seventy-two seconds to deploy them, but then just over a thousand MDMs hurled themselves after Task force Eighty-Two.</p>
<a id="p47" name="p47"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(47)">Seventy-two seconds after that, a second, equally massive salvo launched. Then a third. A fourth. In the space of thirteen minutes, the Havenites fired just under twelve thousand missiles&mdash;almost a third of Bogey Four's total missile loadout&mdash;at the task force's twenty starships.</p>
<a id="p48" name="p48"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(48)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p49" name="p49"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(49)">As little as three or four T-years ago, any one of those avalanches of fire would have been lethally effective against so few targets, and Michelle felt her stomach muscles tightening as the tempest swept towards her. But this <i>wasn't </i>three or four T-years ago. The Royal Manticoran Navy's missile defense doctrine was in a constant state of evolution, continually revised in the face of new threats and the opportunities of new technology, and it had been vastly improved even in the six months since the Battle of Marsh. The<i> Katana</i>-class LACs deployed to cover the task force maneuvered to bring their missile launchers to bear on the incoming fire, but their counter-missiles weren't required yet. Not in an era when the Royal Navy had developed Keyhole and the Mark 31 counter-missile.</p>
<a id="p50" name="p50"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(50)">Each superdreadnought and battlecruiser deployed two Keyhole control platforms, one through each sidewall, and each of those platforms had sufficient telemetry links to control the fire of <i>all </i>of its mother ship's counter-missile launchers simultaneously. Equally important, they allowed the task force's units to roll sideways in space, interposing the impenetrable shields of their impeller wedges against the most dangerous threat axes without compromising their defensive fire control in the least. Each Keyhole also served as a highly sophisticated electronics warfare platform, liberally provided with its own close-in point defense clusters, as well. And as an added bonus, rolling ship gave the platforms sufficient "vertical" separation to see past the interference generated by the impeller wedges of subsequent counter-missile salvos, which made it possible to fire those salvos at far tighter intervals than anyone had ever been able to manage before.</p>
<a id="p51" name="p51"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(51)">The Havenites hadn't made sufficient allowance for how badly Keyhole's EW capability was going to affect their attack missiles' accuracy. Worse, they'd anticipated no more than five CM launches against each of their salvos, and since they'd anticipated facing only the limited fire control arcs of their fleeing targets' after hammerheads, they'd allowed for an average of only ten counter-missiles per ship per launch. Their fire plans had been based on the assumption that they would face somewhere around a thousand ship-launched counter-missiles, and perhaps another thousand or so Mark 31-based Vipers from the <i>Katanas</i>.</p>
<a id="p52" name="p52"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(52)">Michelle Henke had no way of knowing what the enemy's tactical assumptions might have been, but she was reasonably certain they hadn't expected to see over <i>seven </i>thousand counter-missiles from Honor's starships, alone.</p>
<a id="p53" name="p53"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(53)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p54" name="p54"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(54)">"That's a lot of counter-missiles, Ma'am," Commander Manfredi remarked quietly.</p>
<a id="p55" name="p55"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(55)">The chief of staff had paused beside Michelle's command chair on his way back to his own command station, and she glanced up at him, one eyebrow quirked.</p>
<a id="p56" name="p56"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(56)">"I know we've increased our magazine space to accommodate them," he replied to the unspoken question. "Even so, we don't have enough to maintain this volume of defensive fire forever. And they're not exactly inexpensive, either."</p>
<a id="p57" name="p57"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(57)"><i>Either we're both confident as hell, or else we're certifiable lunatics with nothing better to do than </i>pretend <i>we are so we can impress each other with our steely nerve</i>, Michelle thought wryly.</p>
<a id="p58" name="p58"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(58)">"They may not be cheap," she said out loud, returning her attention to her display, "but they're a hell of a lot less expensive than a new ship would be. Not to mention the cost of replacing our own personal hides."</p>
<a id="p59" name="p59"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(59)">"There is that, Ma'am," Manfredi agreed with a lopsided smile. "There is that."</p>
<a id="p60" name="p60"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(60)">"And," Michelle continued with a considerably nastier smile of her own as the leading salvo of Havenite MDMs vanished under the weight of the task force's defensive fire, "I'm willing to bet Mark 31s cost one hell of a lot less than all those <i>attack </i>missiles did, too."</p>
<a id="p61" name="p61"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(61)">The second attack salvo followed the first one into oblivion well short of the inner defensive perimeter. So did the third. And the fourth.</p>
<a id="p62" name="p62"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(62)">"They've ceased fire, Ma'am," Stackpole announced.</p>
<a id="p63" name="p63"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(63)">"I'm not surprised," Michelle murmured. Indeed, if anything surprised her, it was that the Havenites hadn't ceased fire even sooner. On the other hand, maybe she wasn't being fair to her opponents. It had taken seven minutes for the first salvo to enter engagement range, long enough for six more salvos to be launched on its heels. And the effectiveness of the task force's defenses had surpassed even BuWeaps' estimates. If it had come as as big a surprise to the bad guys as she rather expected it had, it was probably unreasonable to expect the other side to realize instantly just how hard to penetrate that defensive wall was. And the only way they had to measure its toughness was to actually hammer at it with their missiles, of course. Still, she liked to think that it wouldn't have taken a full additional six minutes for <i>her </i>to figure out she was throwing good money after bad.</p>
<a id="p64" name="p64"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(64)"><i>On the </i>other <i>other hand, there </i>are <i>those other nine salvos still on the way</i>, she reminded herself. <i>Let's not get too carried away with our own self-confidence, Mike! The last few waves will have had at least a little time to adjust to our EW, won't they? And it only takes one leaker in the wrong place to knock out an alpha node&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or even some overly optimistic rear admiral's command deck</i>.</p>
<a id="p65" name="p65"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(65)">"What do you think they're going to try next, Ma'am?" Manfredi asked as the fifth, sixth, and seventh salvos vanished equally ineffectually.</p>
<a id="p66" name="p66"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(66)">"Well, they've had a chance now to get a feel for just how tough our new doctrine really is," she replied, leaning back in her command chair, eyes still on her tactical repeater. "If it were me over there, I'd be thinking in terms of a really massive salvo. Something big enough to swamp our defenses by literally running us out of control channels for the CMs, no matter how many of them we have."</p>
<a id="p67" name="p67"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(67)">"But they couldn't possibly control something that big, either," Manfredi protested.</p>
<a id="p68" name="p68"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(68)">"We don't <i>think </i>they could control something that big," Michelle corrected almost absently, watching the eighth and ninth missile waves being wiped away. "Mind you, I think you're probably right, but we don't have any way of knowing that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;yet. We could be wrong. And even if we aren't, how much accuracy would they really be giving up at this range, even if they completely cut the control links early and let the birds rely on just their on-board sensors? They wouldn't get very good targeting solutions without shipboard guidance to refine them, but they aren't going to get <i>good </i>solutions at this range anyway, whatever they do, and enough <i>bad </i>solutions to actually break through are likely to be just a bit more useful than perfect solutions that can't get past their targets' defenses, wouldn't you say?"</p>
<a id="p69" name="p69"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(69)">"Put that way, I suppose it does make sense," Manfredi agreed, but it was apparent to Michelle that her chief of staff's sense of professionalism was offended by the idea of relying on what was essentially unaimed fire. The notion's sheer crudity clearly said volumes about the competence (or lack thereof) of any navy which had to rely upon it, as far as he was concerned.</p>
<a id="p70" name="p70"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(70)">Michelle started to twit him for it, then paused with a mental frown. Just how much of a blind spot on Manfredi's part&mdash;or on her own, for that matter&mdash;did that kind of thinking really represent? Manticoran officers were accustomed to looking down their noses at Havenite technology and the crudity of technique its limitations enforced. But there was nothing wrong with a crude technique if it was also an <i>effective </i>one. The Republican Navy had already administered several painful demonstrations of that minor fact, and it was about time officers like Oliver Manfredi&mdash;or Michelle Henke, for that matter&mdash;stopped letting themselves be surprised each time it happened.</p>
<a id="p71" name="p71"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(71)">"I didn't say it would be pretty, Oliver." She allowed the merest hint of reprimand into her tone. "But we don't get paid for 'pretty,' do we?"</p>
<a id="p72" name="p72"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(72)">"No, Ma'am," Manfredi said just a bit more crisply.</p>
<a id="p73" name="p73"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(73)">"Well, neither do they, I feel fairly confident." She smiled, taking the possible sting out of the sentence. "And let's face it, they're still holding the short and smelly end of the hardware stick. Under the circumstances, they've made damned effective use of the capabilities they have this time around. Remember Admiral Bellefeuille? If you don't, <i>I</i> certainly do!" She shook her head wryly. "That woman is <i>devious</i>, and she certainly made the best use of everything she had. I'm afraid I don't see any reason to assume the rest of their flag officers won't go right on doing the same thing, unfortunately."</p>
<a id="p74" name="p74"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(74)">"You're right, Ma'am." Manfredi twitched a smile of his own. "I'll try to bear that in mind next time."</p>
<a id="p75" name="p75"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(75)">"&thinsp;'Next time,'&thinsp;" Michelle repeated, and chuckled. "I like the implication there, Oliver."</p>
<a id="p76" name="p76"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(76)">"<i>Imperator</i> and <i>Intolerant </i>are rolling pods, Ma'am," Stackpole reported.</p>
<a id="p77" name="p77"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(77)">"Sounds like Her Grace's come to the same conclusion you have, Ma'am," Manfredi observed. "That should be one way to keep them from stacking <i>too </i>big a salvo to throw at us!"</p>
<a id="p78" name="p78"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(78)">"Maybe," Michelle replied.</p>
<a id="p79" name="p79"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(79)">The great weakness of missile pods was their vulnerability to proximity kills once they were deployed and outside their mother ship's passive defenses, and Manfredi had a point that incoming Manticoran missiles might well be able to wreak havoc on the Havenite pods. On the other hand, they'd already had time to stack quite a few of them, and it would take Honor's missiles almost eight more minutes to reach their targets across the steadily opening range between the task force and Bogey Four. But at least they were on notice that those missiles were coming.</p>
<a id="p80" name="p80"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(80)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p81" name="p81"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(81)">The Havenite commander didn't wait for the task force's fire to reach him. In fact, he fired at almost the same instant Honor's first salvo launched against <i>him</i>, and whereas Task Force Eighty-Two had fired just under three hundred missiles at him, he fired the next best thing to eleven thousand in reply.</p>
<a id="p82" name="p82"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(82)">"Damn," Commander Manfredi said almost mildly as the enemy returned more than thirty-six missiles for each one TF 82 had just fired at him, then shook his head and glanced at Michelle. "Under normal circumstances, Ma'am, it's reassuring to work for a boss who's good at reading the other side's mind. Just this once, though, I really wish you'd been wrong."</p>
<a id="p83" name="p83"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(83)">"You and I, both," Michelle replied. She studied the data sidebars for several seconds, then turned her command chair to face Stackpole.</p>
<a id="p84" name="p84"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(84)">"Is it my imagination, John, or does their fire control seem just a bit better than it ought to be?"</p>
<a id="p85" name="p85"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(85)">"I'm afraid you're not imagining things, Ma'am," Stackpole replied grimly. "It's a single salvo, all right, and it's going to come in as a single wave. But they've divided it into several 'clumps,' and the clumps appear to be under tighter control than <i>I</i> would have anticipated out of them. If I had to guess, I'd say they've spread them to clear their telemetry paths to each clump and they're using rotating control links, jumping back and forth between each group."</p>
<a id="p86" name="p86"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(86)">"They'd need a lot more bandwidth than they've shown so far," Manfredi said. It wasn't a disagreement with Stackpole, only thoughtful, and Michelle shrugged.</p>
<a id="p87" name="p87"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(87)">"Probably," she said. "But maybe not, too. We don't know enough about what they're doing to decide that."</p>
<a id="p88" name="p88"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(88)">"Without it, they're going to be running the risk of completely dropping control linkages in mid-flight," Manfredi pointed out.</p>
<a id="p89" name="p89"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(89)">"Probably," Michelle repeated. This was no time, she decided, to mention certain recent missile fire control developments Sonja Hemphill and BuWeaps were pursuing. Besides, Manfredi was right. "On the other hand," she continued, "this salvo is ten times the size of anything they've tried before, isn't it? Even if they dropped twenty-five or thirty percent of them, it would still be a hell of a lot heavier weight of fire."</p>
<a id="p90" name="p90"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(90)">"Yes, Ma'am," Manfredi agreed, and smiled crookedly. "More of those bad solutions you were talking about before."</p>
<a id="p91" name="p91"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(91)">"Exactly," Michelle said grimly as the oncoming torrent of Havenite missiles swept into the outermost counter-missile zone.</p>
<a id="p92" name="p92"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(92)">"It looks like they've decided to target us this time, too, Ma'am," Stackpole said, and she nodded.</p>
<a id="p93" name="p93"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(93)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p94" name="p94"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(94)">TF 82's opening missile salvo reached its target first. </p>
<a id="p95" name="p95"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(95)">Unlike the Havenites, Duchess Harrington had opted to concentrate all of her fire on a single target, and Bogey Four's missile defenses opened fire as the Manticoran MDMs swept towards it. The Manticoran electronic warfare platforms scattered among the attack missiles carried far more effective penetration aids than anything the Republic of Haven had, but Haven's defenses had improved even more radically than Manticore's since the last war. They remained substantially inferior to the Star Kingdom's in absolute terms, but the relative improvement was still enormous, and the gap between TF 82's performance and what <i>they </i>could achieve was far narrower than it once would have been. Shannon Foraker's "layered defense" couldn't count on the same sort of accuracy and technological sophistication Manticore could produce, so it depended on sheer weight of fire, instead. And an incredible storm front of counter-missiles raced to meet the threat, fired from the starships' escorting LACs, as well as from the superdreadnoughts themselves. There was so much wedge interference that anything resembling precise control of all that defensive fire was impossible, but with so many counter-missiles in space simultaneously, some of them simply <i>had </i>to hit something.</p>
<a id="p96" name="p96"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(96)">They did. In fact, they hit quite a few "somethings." Of the two hundred and eighty-eight MDMs <i>Intolerant </i>and <i>Imperator </i>had fired at RHNS <i>Conquete</i>, the counter-missiles killed a hundred and thirty-two, and then it was the laser clusters' turn. Each of those clusters had time for only a single shot each, given the missiles' closing speed. At sixty-two percent of light-speed, it took barely half a second from the instant they entered the laser clusters' range for the Manticoran laser heads to reach their own attack range of<i> Conquete</i>. But there were literally thousands of those clusters aboard the superdreadnoughts and their escorting <i>Cimeterre</i>-class light attack craft.</p>
<a id="p97" name="p97"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(97)">Despite everything the superior Manticoran EW could do, Shannon Foraker's defensive doctrine worked. Only eight of TF 82's missiles survived to attack their target. Two of them detonated late, wasting their power on the roof of<i> Conquete</i>'s impenetrable impeller wedge. The other six detonated between fifteen and twenty thousand kilometers off the ship's port bow, and massive bomb-pumped lasers punched brutally through her sidewall.</p>
<a id="p98" name="p98"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(98)">Alarms screamed aboard the Havenite ship as armor shattered, weapons&mdash;and the men and women who manned them&mdash;were wiped out of existence, and atmosphere streamed from<i> Conquete</i>'s lacerated flanks. But superdreadnoughts were designed to survive precisely that kind of damage, and the big ship didn't even falter. She maintained her position in Bogey Four's defensive formation, and her counter-missile launchers were already firing against TF 82's second salvo.</p>
<a id="p99" name="p99"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(99)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p100" name="p100"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(100)">"It looks like we got at least a few through, Ma'am," Stackpole reported, his eyes intent as the studied the reports coming back from the FTL Ghost Rider reconnaissance platforms. </p>
<a id="p101" name="p101"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(101)">"Good," Michelle replied. Of course, "a few" hits probably hadn't done a lot more than scratch their target's paint, but she could always hope, and some damage was a hell of a lot better than no damage at all. Unfortunately&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<a id="p102" name="p102"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(102)">"And here comes their reply," Manfredi muttered. Which, Michelle thought, was something of an&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;understatement.</p>
<a id="p103" name="p103"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(103)">Six hundred of the Havenite MDMs had simply become lost and wandered away, demonstrating the validity of Manfredi's prediction about dropped control links. But that was less than six percent of the total&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;which demonstrated the accuracy of Michelle's counterpoint.</p>
<a id="p104" name="p104"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(104)">The task force's counter-missiles killed almost nine thousand of the missiles which <i>didn't </i>get lost, and the last-ditch fire of the task force's laser clusters and the<i> Katana</i>-class LACs killed nine hundred more.</p>
<a id="p105" name="p105"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(105)">Which left "only" three hundred and seventy-two.</p>
<a id="p106" name="p106"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(106)">Five of them attacked<i> Ajax</i>.</p>
<a id="p107" name="p107"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(107)">Captain Diego Mikhailov rolled ship, twisting his command farther over onto her side relative to the incoming fire, fighting to interpose the defensive barrier of his wedge, and the sensor reach of his Keyhole platforms gave him a marked maneuver advantage, as well as improving his fire control. He could see threats more clearly and from a greater range, which gave him more time to react to them, and most of the incoming X-ray lasers wasted themselves against the floor of his wedge. One of the attacking missiles managed to avoid that fate, however. It swept past<i> Ajax</i> and detonated less than five thousand kilometers from her port sidewall.</p>
<a id="p108" name="p108"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(108)">The battlecruiser twitched as two of the missile's lasers blasted through that sidewall. By the nature of things, battlecruiser armor was far thinner than superdreadnoughts could carry, and Havenite laser heads were heavier than matching Manticoran weapons as a deliberate compensation for their lower base accuracy. Battle steel shattered and alarms howled. Patches of ominous crimson appeared on the damage control schematics, yet given the original size of that mighty salvo,<i> Ajax</i>'s actual damage was remarkably light.</p>
<a id="p109" name="p109"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(109)">"Two hits, Ma'am," Stackpole announced. "We've lost Graser Five and a couple of point defense clusters, and Medical reports seven wounded."</p>
<a id="p110" name="p110"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(110)">Michelle nodded. She hoped none of those seven crewmen were badly wounded. No one ever liked to take casualties, but at the same time, only seven&mdash;none of them fatal, so far at least&mdash;was an almost incredibly light loss rate.</p>
<a id="p111" name="p111"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(111)">"The rest of the squadron?" she asked sharply.</p>
<a id="p112" name="p112"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(112)">"Not a scratch, Ma'am!" Manfredi replied jubilantly from his own command station, and Michelle felt herself beginning to smile. But then&mdash;</p>
<a id="p113" name="p113"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(113)">"Multiple hits on both SDs," Stackpole reported in a much grimmer voice, and Michelle's smile died stillborn. "<i>Imperator</i>'s lost two or three grasers, but she's essentially intact."</p>
<a id="p114" name="p114"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(114)">"And <i>Intolerant</i>?" Michelle demanded harshly when the ops officer paused.</p>
<a id="p115" name="p115"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(115)">"Not good," Manfredi replied as the information scrolled across his display from the task force data net. "She must have taken two or three dozen hits&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and at least one of them blew straight into the missile core. She's got heavy casualties, Ma'am, including Admiral Morowitz and most of his staff. And it looks like all of her pod rails are down."</p>
<a id="p116" name="p116"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(116)">"The Flag is terminating the missile engagement, Ma'am," Stackpole said quietly.</p>
<a id="p117" name="p117"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(117)">He looked up from his display to meet her eyes, and she nodded in bitter understanding. The task force's sustainable long-range firepower had just been cut in half. Not even Manticoran fire control was going to accomplish much at the next best thing to two light-minutes with salvoes the size a single SD(P) could throw, and Honor wasn't going to waste ammunition trying to do the impossible.</p>
<a id="p118" name="p118"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(118)"><i>Which, unfortunately, leaves the question of just what we </i>are <i>going to do wide open, doesn't it? </i>she thought. </p>
<a id="p119" name="p119"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(119)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p120" name="p120"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(120)">Several minutes passed, and Michelle listened to the background flow of clipped, professional voices as her staff officers and their assistants continued refining their assessment of what had just happened. It wasn't getting much better, she reflected, watching the data bars shift as more detailed damage reports flowed in.</p>
<a id="p121" name="p121"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(121)">As Manfredi had already reported, her own squadron&mdash;aside from her flagship&mdash;had suffered no damage at all, but it was beginning to look as if Stackpole's initial assessment of HMS<i> Intolerant</i>'s damages had actually been optimistic.</p>
<a id="p122" name="p122"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(122)">"Admiral," Lieutenant Kaminski said suddenly. Michelle turned towards her staff communications officer, one eyebrow raised. "Duchess Harrington wants to speak to you," he said.</p>
<a id="p123" name="p123"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(123)">"Put her through," Michelle said quickly, and turned back to her own small com screen. A familiar, almond-eyed face appeared upon it almost instantly.</p>
<a id="p124" name="p124"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(124)">"Mike," Honor Alexander-Harrington began without preamble, her crisp, Sphinxian accent only a shade more pronounced than usual, "<i>Intolerant</i>'s in trouble. Her missile defenses are way below par, and we're headed into the planetary pods' envelope. I know<i> Ajax</i>'s taken a few licks of her own, but I want your squadron moved out on our flank. I need to interpose your point defense between <i>Intolerant </i>and Arthur. Are you in shape for that?"</p>
<a id="p125" name="p125"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(125)">"Of course we are." Henke nodded vigorously. Putting something as fragile as a battlecruiser between a wounded superdreadnought and a planet surrounded by missile pods wasn't something to be approached lightly. On the other hand, screening ships of the wall was one of the functions battlecruisers had been designed to fulfill, and at least, given the relative dearth of missile pods their scouts had reported in Arthur orbit, they wouldn't be looking at another missile hurricane like the one which had just roared through the task force.</p>
<a id="p126" name="p126"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(126)">"<i>Ajax</i>'s the only one who's been kissed," Michelle continued, "and our damage is all pretty much superficial. None of it'll have any effect on our missile defense."</p>
<a id="p127" name="p127"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(127)">"Good! Andrea and I will shift the LACs as well, but they've expended a lot of CMs." Honor shook her head. "I didn't think they could stack that many pods without completely saturating their own fire control. It looks like we're going to have to rethink a few things."</p>
<a id="p128" name="p128"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(128)">"That's the nature of the beast, isn't it?" Michelle responded with a shrug. "We live and learn."</p>
<a id="p129" name="p129"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(129)">"Those of us fortunate enough to survive," Honor agreed, a bit grimly. "All right, Mike. Get your people moving. Clear."</p>
<a id="p130" name="p130"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(130)">"Clear," Michelle acknowledged, then turned her chair to face Stackpole and Braga. "You heard the lady," she said. "Let's get them moving."</p>
<a id="p131" name="p131"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(131)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p132" name="p132"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(132)">BCS 81 moved out on Task force Eighty-Two's flank as the Manticoran force continued accelerating steadily away from its pursuers. The final damage reports came in, and Michelle grimaced as she considered how the task force's commanding officer was undoubtedly feeling about those reports. She'd known Honor Harrington since Honor had been a tall, skinny first-form midshipwoman at Saganami Island. It wasn't Honor's fault the Havenites had managed to mousetrap her command, but that wasn't going to matter. Not to Honor Harrington. Those were her ships which had been damaged, her people who had been killed, and at this moment, Michelle Henke knew, she was feeling the hits her task force had taken as if every one of them had landed directly on her.</p>
<a id="p133" name="p133"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(133)"><i>No, that isn't what she's feeling</i>, Michelle told herself. <i>What she's doing right now is wishing that every one of them </i>had <i>landed on her, and she's not going to forgive herself for walking into this. Not for a long time, if I know her. But she's not going to let it affect her decisions, either</i>.</p>
<a id="p134" name="p134"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(134)">She shook her head. It was a pity Honor was so much better at forgiving her subordinates for disasters she knew perfectly well weren't their fault than she was at forgiving herself. Unfortunately, it was too late to change her now.</p>
<a id="p135" name="p135"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(135)"><i>And, truth to tell, I don't think any of us would want to go screwing around </i>trying <i>to change her</i>, Michelle thought wryly.</p>
<a id="p136" name="p136"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(136)">"We'll be entering the estimated range of Arthur's pods in another thirty seconds, Ma'am," Stackpole said quietly, breaking in on her thoughts.</p>
<a id="p137" name="p137"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(137)">"Thank you." Michelle shook herself, then settled herself more solidly into her command chair.</p>
<a id="p138" name="p138"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(138)">"Stand by missile defense," she said.</p>
<a id="p139" name="p139"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(139)">The seconds trickled by, and then&mdash;</p>
<a id="p140" name="p140"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(140)">"Missile launch!" Stackpole announced. "Multiple missile launches, <i>multiple sources</i>!"</p>
<a id="p141" name="p141"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(141)">His voice sharpened with the last two words, and Michelle's head snapped around.</p>
<a id="p142" name="p142"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(142)">"Estimate seventeen thousand, Ma'am!"</p>
<a id="p143" name="p143"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(143)">"Repeat that!" Michelle snapped, certain for an instant that she must have misunderstood him somehow.</p>
<a id="p144" name="p144"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(144)">"CIC says seventeen thousand, Ma'am," Stackpole told her harshly, turning to look at her. "Time to attack range, seven minutes."</p>
<a id="p145" name="p145"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(145)">Michelle stared at him while her mind tried to grapple with the impossible numbers. The remote arrays deployed by the task force's pre-attack scout ships had detected barely four hundred pods in orbit around Arthur. That should have meant a maximum of only <i>four </i>thousand missiles, so where the hell&mdash;?</p>
<a id="p146" name="p146"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(146)">"We've got at least thirteen thousand coming in from Bogey One," Stackpole said, as if he'd just read her mind. His tone was more than a little incredulous, and her own eyes widened in shock. That was even more preposterous. Two superdreadnoughts and seven battlecruisers couldn't possibly have the fire control for that many missiles, even if they'd all been pod designs!</p>
<a id="p147" name="p147"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(147)">"How could&mdash;?" someone began.</p>
<a id="p148" name="p148"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(148)">"Those aren't <i>battlecruisers</i>," Oliver Manfredi said suddenly. "They're frigging <i>minelayers!</i>"</p>
<a id="p149" name="p149"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(149)">Michelle understood him instantly, and her mouth tightened in agreement. Just like the Royal Manticoran Navy, the Republic of Haven built its fast minelayers on battlecruiser hulls. And Manfredi was undoubtedly correct. Instead of normal loads of mines, those ships had been stuffed to the deckhead with missile pods. The whole time they'd been sitting there, watching the task force flee away from Bogey Four and directly towards <i>them</i>, they'd been rolling those pods, stacking them into the horrendous salvo which had just come screaming straight at TF 82.</p>
<a id="p150" name="p150"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(150)">"Well," she said, hearing the harshness in her own voice, "now we understand how they did it. Which still leaves us with the little problem of what we do <i>about </i>it. Execute Hotel, John!"</p>
<a id="p151" name="p151"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(151)">"Defense Plan Hotel, aye, Ma'am," Stackpole acknowledged, and orders began to stream out from HMS <i>Ajax </i>to the rest of her squadron.</p>
<a id="p152" name="p152"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(152)">Michelle watched her plot. There wasn't time for her to adjust her formation significantly, but she'd already set up for Hotel, even though it had seemed unlikely the Havenites' fire could be heavy enough to require it. Her ships' primary responsibility was to protect<i> Intolerant</i>. Looking out for themselves came fairly high on their list of priorities as well, of course, but the superdreadnought represented more combat power&mdash;and almost as much total tonnage&mdash;as her entire squadron combined. That was why Missile Defense Plan Hotel had stacked her battlecruisers vertically in space, like a mobile wall between the planet Arthur and <i>Intolerant</i>. They were perfectly placed to intercept the incoming fire&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;which, unfortunately, meant that they were completely exposed <i>to </i>that fire, as well.</p>
<a id="p153" name="p153"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(153)">"Signal from the Flag, Ma'am," Stackpole said suddenly. "Fire Plan Gamma."</p>
<a id="p154" name="p154"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(154)">"Acknowledged. Execute Fire Plan Gamma," Michelle said tersely.</p>
<a id="p155" name="p155"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(155)">"Aye, aye, Ma'am. Executing Fire Plan Gamma," Stackpole said, and Battlecruiser Squadron Eighty-One began to roll pods at last.</p>
<a id="p156" name="p156"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(156)">It wasn't going to be much of a response compared to the amount of fire coming at the task force, but Michelle felt her lips drawing back from her teeth in satisfaction anyway. The gamma sequence Honor and her tactical staff had worked out months ago was designed to coordinate the battlecruisers' shorter-legged Mark 16s with the superdreadnoughts' MDMs. It would take a Mark 16 over thirteen minutes to reach Bogey One, as compared to the <i>seven </i>minutes one of <i>Imperator</i>'s Mark 23s would require. Both missiles used fusion-powered impeller drives, but there was no physical way to squeeze three complete drives into the smaller missile's tighter dimensions, which meant it simply could not accelerate as long as its bigger brother.</p>
<a id="p157" name="p157"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(157)">So<i>, </i>under Fire Plan Gamma <i>Imperator</i>'s first half-dozen patterns of pod-launched Mark 23s' drive settings had been stepped down to match those of the <i>Agamemnons' </i>less capable missiles. It let the task force put six salvos of almost three hundred mixed Mark 16 and Mark 23 missiles each into space before the superdreadnought began firing hundred-and-twenty-bird salvos at the Mark 23's maximum power settings.</p>
<a id="p158" name="p158"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(158)"><i>All of which is very fine</i>, Michelle thought grimly, watching the icons of the attack missiles go streaking away from the task force. <i>Unfortunately, it doesn't do much about the birds they've already launched</i>.</p>
<a id="p159" name="p159"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(159)">As if to punctuate her thought, <i>Ajax </i>began to quiver with the sharp vibration of outgoing waves of <i>counter</i>-missiles as her launchers went to sustained rapid fire.</p>
<a id="p160" name="p160"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(160)">The Grayson-designed<i> Katana</i>-class LACs were firing, as well, sending their own counter-missiles screaming to meet the attack, but no one in her worst nightmare had ever envisioned facing a single salvo this massive.</p>
<a id="p161" name="p161"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(161)">"It's coming through, Ma'am," Manfredi said quietly.</p>
<a id="p162" name="p162"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(162)">She looked back up from her plot, and her lips tightened as she saw him standing beside her command chair once more. Given what was headed towards them at the moment, he really ought to have been back in the shock frame and protective armored shell of his own chair. <i>And he damned well</i> knows<i> it, too</i>, she thought in familiar, sharp-edged irritation. But he'd always been a roamer, and she'd finally given up yelling at him for it. He was one of those people who <i>needed</i> to move around to keep their brains running at the maximum possible RPM. Now his voice was too low pitched for anyone else to have heard as he gazed down into her repeater plot with her, but his eyes were bleak.</p>
<a id="p163" name="p163"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(163)">"Of course it is," she replied, equally quietly. The task force simply didn't have the firepower to stop that many missiles in the time available to it.</p>
<a id="p164" name="p164"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(164)">"How the <i>hell </i>are they managing to control that many birds?" Manfredi continued, never looking away from the plot. "Look at that pattern. Those aren't blind-fired shots; they're under tight control, for now at least. So where in hell did they find that many control channels?"</p>
<a id="p165" name="p165"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(165)">"Don't have a clue," Michelle admitted, her tone almost absent as she watched the defenders' fire ripping huge holes in the cloud of incoming missiles. "I think we'd better figure it out, though. Don't you?"</p>
<a id="p166" name="p166"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(166)">"You've got that right, Ma'am," he agreed with a mirthless smile.</p>
<a id="p167" name="p167"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(167)" align="center"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p168" name="p168"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(168)">No one in Task force Eighty-Two&mdash;or anyone in the rest of the Royal Manticoran Navy, for that matter&mdash;had ever heard of the control system Shannon Foraker had dubbed "Moriarty" after a pre-space fictional character. If they had, and if they'd understood the reference, they probably would have agreed that it was appropriate, however.</p>
<a id="p169" name="p169"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(169)">One thing of which no one would ever be able to accuse Foraker was thinking small. Faced with the problem of controlling a big enough missile salvo to break through the steadily improving Manticoran missile defenses, she'd been forced to accept that Havenite ships of the wall, even the latest podnoughts, simply lacked the necessary fire control channels. So, she'd set out to solve the problem. Unable to match the technological capability to shoehorn the control systems she needed into something like Manticore's Keyhole, she'd simply accepted that she had to build something bigger. <i>Much </i>bigger. And while she'd been at it, she'd decided, she might as well figure out how to integrate that "something bigger" into an entire star system's defenses.</p>
<a id="p170" name="p170"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(170)">Moriarty was the answer she'd come up with. It consisted of remotely deployed platforms which existed for the sole purpose of providing telemetry relays and control channels. They were distributed throughout the entire volume of space inside Solon's hyper limit, and every one of them reported to a single control station which was about the size of a heavy cruiser&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and contained nothing except the very best fire control computers and software the Republic of Haven could build.</p>
<a id="p171" name="p171"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(171)">She couldn't do anything about the light-speed limitations of the control channels themselves, but she'd finally found a way to provide enough of those channels to handle truly massive salvos. In fact, although TF 82 had no way of knowing it, the wave of missiles coming at it was less than half of Moriarty's maximum capacity.</p>
<a id="p172" name="p172"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(172)">Of course, even if the task force's tactical officers had known that, they might have felt less than completely grateful, given the weight of fire which <i>was </i>coming at them.</p>
<a id="p173" name="p173"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(173)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p174" name="p174"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(174)">Michelle never knew how many of the incoming missiles were destroyed short of their targets, or how many simply got lost, despite all Moriarty could do, and wandered off or acquired targets other than the ones they'd originally been assigned. It was obvious that the task force's defenses managed to stop an enormous percentage them. Unfortunately, it was even more obvious that they hadn't stopped <i>enough </i>of them.</p>
<a id="p175" name="p175"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(175)">Hundreds of them hurled themselves at the LACs&mdash;not because anyone had wanted to waste MDMs on something as small as a LAC, but because missiles which had lost their original targets as they spread beyond the reach of Moriarty's light-speed commands had acquired them, instead. LACs, and especially Manticoran and Grayson LACs, were very difficult for missiles to hit. Which was not to say that they were <i>impossible </i>to hit, however, and over two hundred of them were blown out of space as the tornado of missiles ripped into the task force.</p>
<a id="p176" name="p176"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(176)">Most of the rest of Moriarty's missiles had been targeted on the two superdreadnoughts, and they howled in on their targets like demons. Captain Rafe Cardones maneuvered Honor's flagship as if the stupendous superdreadnought were a heavy cruiser, twisting around to interpose his wedge while jammers and decoys joined with laser clusters in a last-ditch, point-blank defense.<i> Imperator</i> shuddered and bucked as laser heads blasted through her sidewalls, but despite grievous wounds, she actually got off lightly. Not even her massive armor was impervious to such a concentrated rain of destruction, but it did its job, preserving her core hull and essential systems intact, and her human casualties were minuscule in proportion to the amount of fire scorching in upon her.</p>
<a id="p177" name="p177"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(177)"><i>Intolerant</i> was less fortunate.</p>
<a id="p178" name="p178"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(178)">The earlier damage to <i>Imperator</i>'s sister ship was simply too severe. She'd lost both of her Keyholes and all too many of her counter-missile launchers and laser clusters in the last attack. Her sensors had been battered, leaving holes in her own close-in coverage, and her electronic warfare systems were far below par. She was simply the biggest, most visible, most vulnerable target in the entire task force, and despite everything BCS 81 could do, droves of myopic end-of-run Havenite MDMs hurled themselves at the clearest target they could see.</p>
<a id="p179" name="p179"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(179)">The superdreadnought was trapped at the heart of a maelstrom of detonating laser heads, hurling X-ray lasers like vicious harpoons. They slammed into her again and again and again, ripping and maiming, tearing steadily deeper while the big ship shuddered and bucked in agony. And then, finally, one of those lasers found something fatal and HMS <i>Intolerant </i>and her entire company vanished into a glaring fireball of destruction.</p>
<a id="p180" name="p180"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(180)">Nor did she die alone.</p>
<a id="p181" name="p181"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(181)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p182" name="p182"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(182)">HMS<i> Ajax</i> heaved indescribably as the universe went mad. </p>
<a id="p183" name="p183"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(183)">Compared to the torrent of fire streaming in on the two superdreadnoughts, only a handful of missiles attacked the battlecruisers. But that "handful" was still numbered in the hundreds, and they were much more fragile targets. Alarms screamed as deadly lasers ripped deep into far more lightly armored hulls, and the <i>Agamemnon</i>-class were podlayers. They had the hollow cores of their type, and that made them even more fragile than other, older battlecruisers little more than half their size. Michelle had always wondered if that aspect of their design was as great a vulnerability as the BC(P)'s critics had always contended. </p>
<a id="p184" name="p184"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(184)">It looked like they&mdash;and she&mdash;were about to find out.</p>
<a id="p185" name="p185"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(185)">Oliver Manfredi was hurled from his feet as <i>Ajax </i>lurched, and Michelle felt her command chair's shock frame hammering viciously at her. Urgent voices, high-pitched and distorted despite the professionalism trained bone-deep into their owners, filled the com channels with messages of devastation&mdash;announcements of casualties, of destroyed systems, which ended all too often in mid-syllable as death came for the men and women making those reports.</p>
<a id="p186" name="p186"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(186)">Even through the pounding, Michelle saw the icons of both of her second division's ships&mdash;<i>Priam </i>and <i>Patrocles&mdash;</i>disappear abruptly from her plot, and other icons disappeared or flashed critical damage codes throughout the task force's formation. The light cruisers <i>Fury</i>, <i>Buckler</i>, and <i>Atum </i>vanished in glaring flashes of destruction, and the heavy cruisers<i> Star Ranger</i> and<i> Blackstone</i> were transformed into crippled hulks, coasting onward ballistically without power or impeller wedges. And then&mdash;</p>
<a id="p187" name="p187"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(187)">"Direct hit on the command deck!" one of Stackpole's ratings announced. "No survivors, Sir! Heavy damage to Boat Bay Two, and Boat Bay One's been completely destroyed! Engineering reports&mdash;"</p>
<a id="p188" name="p188"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(188)">Michelle felt it in her own flesh as HMS <i>Ajax </i>faltered suddenly.</p>
<a id="p189" name="p189"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(189)">"We've lost the after ring, Ma'am!" Stackpole said harshly. "<i>All </i>of it."</p>
<a id="p190" name="p190"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(190)">Michelle bit the inside of her lower lip so hard she tasted blood. Solon lay in the heart of a hyper-space gravity wave. No ship could enter, navigate, or long survive in a gravity wave without both Warshawski sails&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and without the after impeller ring's alpha nodes, <i>Ajax </i>could no longer generate an after sail.</p>
