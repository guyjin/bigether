<a id="p4963" name="p4963"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4963)">"Hyper footprint, Lieutenant," the sensor tech announced, and Lieutenant Oliver Bristow raised an eyebrow and bent over the tech's shoulder to eyeball the display himself. </p>
<a id="p4964" name="p4964"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4964)">Despite its status as the administrative center of the Madras Sector, the Meyers System was scarcely a bustling hive of interstellar commerce. In fact, it was a rare day that saw more than two or three hyper translations, and it was scarcely unheard of for days or even weeks to go by with no new arrivals at all.</p>
<a id="p4965" name="p4965"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4965)">Traffic had been a bit more brisk since the fiasco in the Monica System, but most of the "special investigators" and representatives of the Inspector General's office had already come and gone. Most of them hadn't even bothered to unpack, as far as Bristow could tell. The fact that they'd come all the way out to Meyers was sufficient proof of their devotion to duty, and there was no point actually investigating anything, since most of them had been informed of their reports' conclusions before they were dispatched in the first place.</p>
<a id="p4966" name="p4966"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4966)">But business had been picking up again for Meyers Astro Control lately. The arrival of Admiral Crandall's task force three weeks earlier had been as much excitement as Bristow had ever seen here in Meyers. Admiral Byng's battlecruiser squadrons had represented more firepower than any system out in the Verge was ever likely to see, but they were dwarfed by Task Force 496. Bristow couldn't think of the last time he'd seen even one actual ship of the wall all the way out here, far less an entire task force of them with appropriate screening elements! He wasn't sure what Admiral Crandall was doing out here, but he was fairly confident she hadn't made the trip just for her health, and that made every unexpected arrival interesting. One never knew which of them might be whatever the hell it was Crandall was waiting for.</p>
<a id="p4967" name="p4967"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4967)">"What do you make of it, Coker?" he asked.</p>
<a id="p4968" name="p4968"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4968)">"Hard to say from this range, Sir." </p>
<a id="p4969" name="p4969"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4969)">Petty Officer 2/c Alan Coker, like Bristow, was Frontier Fleet, and the lieutenant suspected that a Battle Fleet officer like the ones on Byng's staff or aboard Crandall's superdreadnoughts would have found the petty officer's tone lamentably unprofessional. Bristow didn't. Which probably had a little to do with the fact that he assumed that, unlike most Battle Fleet officers he could name, Petty Officer Coker could actually find his own posterior if he got to use both hands.</p>
<a id="p4970" name="p4970"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4970)">"We've been telling them for months that we need to replace the arrays covering that sector," the petty officer continued more than a little sourly, "and resolution's not anything I'd care to screen home about. If I had to guess, though, I'd say it's probably a destroyer from the impeller signature. <i>Might </i>be a light cruiser&mdash;some of the piss pot 'navies' out here still have some awfully small 'cruisers' in inventory&mdash;but I don't think it's anything bigger than that, anyway."</p>
<a id="p4971" name="p4971"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4971)">"A light cruiser?" Bristow straightened slowly, scratching one eyebrow.</p>
<a id="p4972" name="p4972"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4972)">"Maybe, Sir. Like I say, though, it's more likely a destroyer," Coker replied, and Bristow nodded.</p>
<a id="p4973" name="p4973"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4973)">"Keep an eye on it. Let me know as soon as it squawks its transponder."</p>
<a id="p4974" name="p4974"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4974)">"Yes, Sir."</p>
<a id="p4975" name="p4975"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4975)">Bristow patted him absently on the shoulder, folded his hands behind himself, and began to pace slowly and thoughtfully back and forth across the limited width of the compartment. Coker was right about the condition of the arrays in question, but the petty officer was also a past master at getting balky equipment to do his bidding, and he had a good eye for ship IDs. So if he said that was a destroyer, it probably <i>was </i>a destroyer. Which was interesting, since so far as Bristow knew, the only <i>Solarian</i> destroyers in the sector were all either off with Admiral Byng or already right here in-system.</p>
<a id="p4976" name="p4976"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4976)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p4977" name="p4977"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4977)">"Permission to enter the bridge, Captain?"</p>
<a id="p4978" name="p4978"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4978)">Gregor O'Shaughnessy might have had his odd moments of disagreement with the Star Kingdom's military, but it was clear he'd learned the rudiments of naval courtesy along the way, and he was always careful to observe protocol aboard ship. It wasn't what Denton had expected out of someone with his prickly reputation, and the commander had found himself wondering if perhaps O'Shaughnessy was so careful because of that history of his. Whether that was the case or not, though, he'd gone out of his way&mdash;successfully&mdash;to be a pleasant passenger on the almost six-week voyage from Spindle to Meyers.</p>
<a id="p4979" name="p4979"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4979)">"Permission granted, Mr. O'Shaughnessy," Denton said now, and pointed at the chair at Heather McGill's left elbow. It would have been occupied by Ensign Varislav, the junior assistant tactical officer, at battle stations, but it was empty at the moment. </p>
<a id="p4980" name="p4980"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4980)">"Have a seat," he invited.</p>
<a id="p4981" name="p4981"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4981)">"Thank you, Captain."</p>
<a id="p4982" name="p4982"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4982)">O'Shaughnessy crossed to the indicated bridge chair and settled into it, careful to keep his hands well away from the console in front of it or the chair arm keypads. Heather turned her head to smile at him, and he smiled back. The ATO's place was where Commander Denton normally parked him when he visited the bridge, and Heather had gotten to know the analyst rather better than she'd ever expected to.</p>
<a id="p4983" name="p4983"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4983)">She'd also locked out the control pads he was so carefully avoiding, though she had no intention of telling him so. First, because she didn't want to risk rubbing in any perceived distrust in his ability to keep his hands out of trouble, and, second, because there was something rather touching&mdash;almost endearing&mdash;about how cautious he actually was.</p>
<a id="p4984" name="p4984"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4984)">She turned back to her own displays, watching the expanding hemisphere covered by her Ghost Rider platforms. As <i>Reprise </i>proceeded deeper into the system and the platforms closed in astern of her, watching her back, that hemisphere would become a complete sphere, but at the moment, CIC's attention&mdash;and Heather's&mdash;was focused on the leading edge of the surveillance zone.</p>
<a id="p4985" name="p4985"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4985)"><i>Reprise</i>'s hyper translation lay thirty-five minutes in the past. The destroyer's closing velocity relative to the system primary had risen to 20,296 KPS, and she'd traveled just under thirty-two million kilometers farther in-system. In that same interval, the Ghost Rider platforms, loping along at the low (for them) acceleration of only five thousand gravities in order to stay stealthy, had already moved three minutes past their turnover time. They were over sixty million kilometers ahead of the destroyer, with their velocity back down to a mere 85,413 KPS, which also meant they were only seventy-three million kilometers from Meyers, and four light-minutes was close enough for their passive instrumentation to begin picking up more detailed information.</p>
<a id="p4986" name="p4986"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4986)">She waited patiently, since Commander Denton had decided they would rely on directed lasers rather than the platforms' FTL capability. As a result, anything Heather saw would be just over four minutes old by the time it reached her. Not that she expected the delay to have any significant consequences, and it wasn't as if anyone&mdash;</p>
<a id="p4987" name="p4987"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4987)">An unanticipated icon blinked suddenly into existence on her display. Another one followed, and another, and the data sidebar began to flicker and change.</p>
<a id="p4988" name="p4988"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4988)">"Captain," she heard her own voice say calmly, "I'm picking up some unexpected readings. A lot of them."</p>
<a id="p4989" name="p4989"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4989)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p4990" name="p4990"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4990)">"You're confident about this, Captain?"</p>
<a id="p4991" name="p4991"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4991)">"Yes, Mr. O'Shaughnessy, I am," Lewis Denton said, speaking rather more coolly to Baroness Medusa's personal representative than was his wont.</p>
<a id="p4992" name="p4992"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4992)">"I'm sorry," O'Shaughnessy said quickly. "I didn't mean to sound as if I were challenging the competency of any of your personnel, and particularly not Lieutenant McGill's. It's just that I'm having trouble wrapping my own mind around the implications. I guess it comes under the heading of asking redundant questions while I spar for time to get my brain working again."</p>
<a id="p4993" name="p4993"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4993)">"No apology necessary," Denton said in a more normal tone. "And I don't blame you. I never expected to see something like this out in the Verge, either. And just between you and me, I'm not very happy to be seeing it now."</p>
<a id="p4994" name="p4994"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4994)">"Amazing how we're thinking the same thing, isn't it?" O'Shaughnessy replied, and Denton snorted harshly, then turned back to the updated tactical plot.</p>
<a id="p4995" name="p4995"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4995)"><i>Reprise</i> had stopped accelerating and started coasting ballistically twenty-six minutes earlier. During that interval, her recon platforms had reached their destinations, spreading out to englobe the planet Meyers at a range of barely fifteen light-seconds. At that distance, there could be no mistake. There really were seventy-one Solarian superdreadnoughts, accompanied by sixteen battlecruisers, twelve heavy cruisers, twenty-three light cruisers, and eighteen destroyers orbiting the planet.</p>
<a id="p4996" name="p4996"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4996)"><i>Not to mention three repair ships, what have to be a couple of dozen stores ships, and what looks like a pair of straight ammunition carriers. It would appear New Tuscany isn't the only star system out this way benefitting from Battle Fleet's attention of late</i>, he thought ironically.</p>
<a id="p4997" name="p4997"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4997)">"May I ask a question, Mr. O'Shaughnessy?" he said.</p>
<a id="p4998" name="p4998"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4998)">"Captain, you can ask anything you like." The analyst turned to face him, his expression serious. "Believe me, you're cleared for anything you think you need to know in a situation like this one."</p>
<a id="p4999" name="p4999"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(4999)">"Thank you, Sir. I appreciate that. What I was wondering was whether or not any one's come up with a better theory for how a Battle Fleet admiral ended up in command of a Frontier Fleet task group?"</p>
<a id="p5000" name="p5000"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5000)">"Given what we know about Byng, it didn't just happen by the luck of the draw," O'Shaughnessy said grimly. "Byng hates Frontier Fleet. Not as much as he hates <i>us</i>, maybe, but badly enough. He's got the connections to avoid an assignment like this one without even raising a sweat, too. And that completely ignores the fact that Frontier Fleet must've screamed bloody murder when it found out it was expected to hand a command like that over to anyone from Battle Fleet, far less Byng. Somebody with a lot of influence had to get him nominated for the command, and he had to want to accept it."</p>
<a id="p5001" name="p5001"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5001)">"That's pretty much the way I figured it already," Denton said. "The reason I asked is that I have to find myself doubting that these people"&mdash;he pointed at the display with his chin&mdash;"just happen to be here by the luck of the draw, either. I think there's a connection between them and Byng. In fact, the evidence seems to be screaming pretty loudly that we're looking at a setup."</p>
<a id="p5002" name="p5002"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5002)">"I'm very much afraid I agree with you," O'Shaughnessy said heavily. "I wish to God I didn't, and I suppose there <i>might </i>be some other explanation for it,. But if there is, I haven't been able to think of what it might be yet, either."</p>
<a id="p5003" name="p5003"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5003)">"I don't think Byng fired on Commodore Chatterjee by accident or in a panic." Denton's voice was hard, harsh-edged. "Not anymore. I don't know who's behind it, although I'd be willing to hazard a few guesses based on what's already happened here in the Quadrant, but someone wants us in a war with the League. And these people"&mdash;another quick, angry jut of his chin at the master plot&mdash;"are the hammer that's supposed to make sure it's a short, <i>nasty</i> war."</p>
<a id="p5004" name="p5004"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5004)">"We probably don't want to wed ourselves too immovably to that conclusion, Captain. I say that purely as a professional analyst who's gone a bit too far out on a limb upon occasion only to see it sawed off behind him. Having cast my professional sheet anchor to windward, however, I think you're absolutely right. But unlike you, I don't have any idea of just how bad the military odds really are, given these people's presence, and I'd like to get one."</p>
<a id="p5005" name="p5005"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5005)">"Against what we've got in the Quadrant right now?" Denton raised an eyebrow at him, and he nodded. "Not good," the commander said. "In fact, that's understating the situation fairly significantly. In technical terms, I believe the phrase would be 'We're screwed.'&thinsp;"</p>
<a id="p5006" name="p5006"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5006)">"I was afraid that was what you were going to say."</p>
<a id="p5007" name="p5007"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5007)">"Don't get me wrong, Mr. O'Shaughnessy. We could hurt them, probably even pretty badly, but no way in the galaxy could we <i>stop </i>them if they're prepared to keep coming. The battlecruisers and the small fry&mdash;<i>phfffft!</i>" Denton snapped his fingers. "But those big bastards are something else entirely. We could probably rip hell out of them as long as the Mark 23 pods hold out, but it would take a lot of hits&mdash;even with the Mark 23&mdash;to kill one of them, and we don't have an unlimited supply of the pods. Worse than that, we don't have <i>any</i> podnoughts. That means we can only carry and deploy pods externally, which makes them a lot more vulnerable and tactically less flexible. They'd be at their most effective in a purely defensive deployment, with lots of shipboard control links to manage them, but to make that work, we'd have to figure out where we needed them far enough in advance to get them&mdash;and enough ships to control them in worthwhile salvos&mdash;there before the Sollies came calling, and that wouldn't exactly be a trivial challenge.</p>
<a id="p5008" name="p5008"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5008)">"It's more likely we'd find ourselves having to face up to them without a powerful pod reserve&mdash;especially if we decide we have to insure the security of Spindle and dump most of the pods there. If that happens, we'll have to use mobile units to cover the Quadrant's other systems, and that means nothing heavier than a <i>Nike</i> or a <i>Saganami-C</i>. And <i>that </i>means using primarily whatever we can fire from our internal tubes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; which sure as hell <i>doesn't </i>mean Mark 23s.</p>
<a id="p5009" name="p5009"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5009)">"From what I've heard about the new Mark 16 warhead mods, we could probably get in some good licks even against wallers, once the pods are gone, but I don't think we could do enough to knock them out. Certainly not in large enough numbers to do us any good. And that's assuming they didn't just decide to split up into smaller task units and go after each of the Quadrant's star systems individually&mdash;which, by the way, would require us to parcel out everything we've got, not just the Mark 23 pods&mdash;on a penny-packet basis if we wanted to try to give some cover to the Quadrant as a whole. But our only real chance of inflicting significant damage on wallers would be to stay concentrated and hammer them with everything we've got from outside their effective powered envelope. Splitting up into smaller units to defend multiple targets would hurt us more than it would hurt them."</p>
<a id="p5010" name="p5010"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5010)">"What about the Lynx Terminus?"</p>
<a id="p5011" name="p5011"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5011)">"That's probably another story, Sir. For one thing, most of the forts are on-line now, and each of them is a hell of a lot tougher than any piece-of-crap Solly superdreadnought ever built. And for another thing, Home Fleet is right on the other side of the terminus. Trust me. If these people want to dance with Duchess Harrington after what she did to the Peeps at Manticore, they're toast."</p>
<a id="p5012" name="p5012"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5012)">"What do you think they'll do?"</p>
<a id="p5013" name="p5013"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5013)">"I'm only a destroyer skipper, Mr. O'Shaughnessy. One with a nasty suspicious streak, maybe, but only a destroyer skipper. That kind of strategic assessment is <i>way </i>above my pay grade."</p>
<a id="p5014" name="p5014"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5014)">"I realize that. And I'm not going to hold you to anything. But I'd really like to hear your thoughts."</p>
<a id="p5015" name="p5015"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5015)">"Well, if it was me, and if we really are looking at some kind of orchestrated plan, a setup designed to get us out of the Quadrant once and for all, I'd start by taking out the administrative center of the Quadrant."</p>
<a id="p5016" name="p5016"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5016)">"You'd go for Spindle?"</p>
<a id="p5017" name="p5017"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5017)">"In a skinny minute, Sir," Denton said flatly. "I'd head straight there on the assumption that if the Manties tried to fight me, they'd have to come to me, well away from the terminus, on my terms. I'd figure I was going to take some nasty lumps, but that the Admiralty would never allow any really heavy force to get too far away from the Lynx Terminus, given the situation back home. So all I'd really have to take on would be whatever Admiral Gold Peak had under her command. And if she <i>didn't </i>try to fight me, the Star Empire would effectively concede possession of the entire Talbott Cluster, which would let me gather up all the other systems at my leisure. I might not get to kill as many Manty starships, but I'd have taken what would probably be my primary objectives for minimal losses. Not to mention the morale damage I would have inflicted on all those people who'd just voted to join the Star Empire if the Navy cuts and runs instead of trying to defend them."</p>
<a id="p5018" name="p5018"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5018)">He spoke coldly, confidently, but then he visibly paused and took a step back. </p>
<a id="p5019" name="p5019"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5019)">"I said that's what I'd do if it was my call, and I think it's what anyone on the other side would do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if he were capable of finding his ass with both hands and <i>if</i> he had a realistic appreciation for the actual balance of military capabilities. From what we've seen of the Sollies, though, it's entirely possible they don't have that realistic appreciation. In which case, they might just decide to head direct for the Terminus, after all. The logic would be pretty compelling, given that kind of misestimate of the relative balance of combat effectiveness. Seize and hold the Terminus, cut us off from any relief from the home system, then steamroller the forces isolated out here in the Quadrant. So I guess the bottom line is that without any clearer idea of how accurately they've assessed our capabilities, it's really impossible to say which way they're going to jump. Except, of course, that I think we can be fairly confident it will be a way we won't like."</p>
<a id="p5020" name="p5020"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5020)">"As I said earlier, it's amazing how we seem to be thinking the same thing," O'Shaughnessy said.</p>
<a id="p5021" name="p5021"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5021)">"Well, with all due respect, Sir, I think it's time we aborted your diplomatic mission. Somehow, I don't think protesting Byng's actions or presenting a note explaining our response is going to do much good. And given what happened the last time some of our destroyers got too close to Solarian <i>battlecruisers</i>, I'd just as soon not get any closer than this to Solarian ships of the wall!"</p>
<a id="p5022" name="p5022"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5022)">"Captain, for what it's worth, I concur entirely."</p>
<a id="p5023" name="p5023"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5023)" align="center">* * *</p>
<a id="p5024" name="p5024"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5024)">"There it is again, Lieutenant," PO Coker said.</p>
<a id="p5025" name="p5025"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5025)">"Where?" </p>
<a id="p5026" name="p5026"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5026)">Bristow looked over the petty officer's shoulder again, frowning. The impeller signature of the elusive destroyer, assuming that was what it was, had disappeared a half-hour earlier. Now it was back again, but where it had been accelerating in-system at five hundred gravities, it was now<i> decelerating</i> at well over six hundred. Clearly, it had changed its mind about its destination.</p>
<a id="p5027" name="p5027"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5027)">"Never did squawk their transponder, Sir," Coker observed.</p>
<a id="p5028" name="p5028"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5028)">"No, I noticed that myself, PO," Bristow replied with a touch of irony, and Coker chuckled.</p>
<a id="p5029" name="p5029"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5029)">"Suppose they saw something they didn't much care for, Sir?"</p>
<a id="p5030" name="p5030"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5030)">"That's exactly what I think," Bristow said slowly, "and that's what bothers me."</p>
<a id="p5031" name="p5031"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5031)">"Sir?"</p>
<a id="p5032" name="p5032"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5032)">"Just how the hell did they see anything to make them nervous from way the hell and gone out there?" Bristow asked, and the petty officer frowned. It wasn't a particularly happy frown, and Bristow nodded slowly. "That's what I thought, myself. Of course, whether or not we can convince Admiral Crandall of it is something else entirely, isn't it?"</p>
<a id="p5033" name="p5033"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5033)" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<a id="p5034" name="p5034"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5034)">Fleet Admiral Sandra Crandall was a solidly built woman with mahogany-colored hair and hard brown eyes. She was always immaculately groomed and uniformed, perfectly tailored, and yet it seemed to Hongbo Junyan that some subliminal whiff of decay followed her around like rancid incense.</p>
<a id="p5035" name="p5035"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5035)">On the plus side, she seemed to be smarter than Josef Byng. On the negative side, she was even stubborner and at least as thoroughly imbued with Battle Fleet arrogance as he was.</p>
<a id="p5036" name="p5036"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5036)">Or as he'd <i>been</i>, rather, Hongbo corrected himself. The Navy dispatch boat from New Tuscany which had arrived just over two hours ago had announced the change in its late commanding admiral's corporeal status. Personally, Hongbo would have considered that change a positive step even if it hadn't pushed events exactly where his Manpower&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;patrons wanted them to go. Not everyone shared that view of the universe, however, and it had upset Admiral Crandall just a tad.</p>
<a id="p5037" name="p5037"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5037)">Which was rather the point of this afternoon's meeting.</p>
<a id="p5038" name="p5038"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5038)">"I don't <i>care </i>what their frigging 'warning messages' to Josef said!" Crandall snarled, glaring across the conference table at Lorcan Verrochio as if <i>he </i>were a Manty. "And I don't give a good goddamn what happened to <i>their </i>damned destroyers! The bastards fired on and destroyed a <i>Solarian League Navy</i> battlecruiser with all hands!"</p>
<a id="p5039" name="p5039"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5039)">"But only after Admiral Byng had&mdash;" Verrochio began.</p>
<a id="p5040" name="p5040"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5040)">"I don't give a flying fuck what Byng may or may not have done!" Crandall interrupted furiously, her expression livid. "First, because the only evidence we have is what they've seen fit to provide us, and I don't trust it as far as I can damned well spit. But second, and even more importantly, because it damned well doesn't <i>matter</i>! The Solarian League can't accept something like this&mdash;not out of some frigging little pissant navy out beyond the Verge&mdash;no matter what kind of provocation they may think they have! If we let them get away with this, God only knows who's going to try something stupid next!"</p>
<a id="p5041" name="p5041"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5041)">"But the Manticorans aren't a typical&mdash;"</p>
<a id="p5042" name="p5042"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5042)">"<i>Don't </i>tell me about their super weapons again, Mr. Commissioner," Crandall snapped. "I'll grant you that they obviously have much longer ranged missiles than we'd appreciated. That may actually make some sense of the preposterous stories we've been hearing about their damned war with the Havenites. But what they could do against a dozen Frontier Fleet battlecruisers won't help them very much against modern, integrated missile defense from nine squadrons of the wall, plus screen. Trust me, they'll need something more than a few fancy tricks with missiles to stop <i>my </i>task force! And I don't intend to stand here with my thumb up my ass while they get themselves organized."</p>
<a id="p5043" name="p5043"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5043)">"What do you mean, 'organized,' Admiral?" Hongbo asked in a carefully unprovocative tone.</p>
<a id="p5044" name="p5044"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5044)">"I mean they obviously didn't have any idea my task force was anywhere in the vicinity, or they wouldn't have tried this shit in the first place. But they damned well know now. Or they know more than they did, at any rate. Just who the hell do you think that mysterious hyper footprint yesterday morning was, Mr. Hongbo? I don't know what it was doing here, but I know damned well it was a Manty, and whoever it was, she's on her way straight back to tell her superiors about my wall of battle. Well now that they know, I don't intend to give them time to send wallers of their own through from Manticore!"</p>
<a id="p5045" name="p5045"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5045)">"Admiral," Verrochio said as forcefully as he could (speaking for the recorders, of course), "I cannot authorize any sort of action or reprisal against the Manticorans without approval from higher authority within the Ministry!" He raised one hand like a stop sign and continued quickly as Crandall seemed to swell visibly. "I'm not saying you aren't totally justified in your feelings. And assuming the information available to us at this time is accurate, I think it's extremely likely Ministry approval would be forthcoming. As you say, allowing something like this to go unchallenged, to set some sort of precedent for other neobarb navies, could be disastrous. But making a decision which would amount to going to war with a multi-system stellar power, especially one so deeply involved in the League's carrying trade, is well beyond the scope of my authority as a Frontier Security governor."</p>
<a id="p5046" name="p5046"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5046)">Hongbo felt an unusual glow of admiration for his nominal superior's footwork. If Verrochio had shown the ability to play Byng like a violin, he was playing Crandall like an entire string quartet! This was working out even better than either of them had hoped, at least from the perspective of evading responsibility. From the perspective of what was about to happen to other people, it was something else entirely, he supposed. But there wasn't much he could do about that, and from a purely selfish viewpoint, it could hardly have been better. He and Verrochio had performed to specification, which ought to get Ottweiler and his employers off their necks, and managed to cover their tracks quite neatly along the way. It had been Byng's decision to depart for New Tuscany, and while Hongbo was genuinely shocked at what the Manties had done&mdash;and how easily they'd done it&mdash;no one could possibly fault him or Verrochio for it. And now Verrochio had gotten himself, and by extension Hongbo, on record as the civilian voice of reason in the face of spinal-reflex military pugnacity.</p>
<a id="p5047" name="p5047"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5047)"><i>Which is probably going to be a</i> very <i>good thing if it turns out that our good admiral has underestimated the Manties even </i>half <i>as badly as I think she has</i>, the vice-commissioner thought. <i>She's thinking in terms of standard reprisals against uppity neobarbs, something the Navy's done hundreds of times, whether it admits it or not. But these aren't your typical neobarbs, even based solely on what's happened</i> <i>already. Unfortunately, she doesn't even have a clue how different they are, and she's not prepared to listen to someone like Thurgood. After all, he's only Frontier Fleet. What could </i>he <i>know about fights between ships of the wall?</i></p>
<a id="p5048" name="p5048"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5048)">"Well," Crandall didn't quite sneer, in response to Verrochio's protest, "you undoubtedly know the limits of your authority better than I do, Sir. However,<i> </i>I<i> </i>know the limits of <i>my </i>authority, and I also recognize my responsibilities. So, with all due respect for your need for Ministry approval, I have no intention of waiting for it."</p>
<a id="p5049" name="p5049"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5049)">"What do you mean?" Verrochio asked, his voice taut.</p>
<a id="p5050" name="p5050"></a><p onmouseover="PNo(5050)">"I mean I'll be underway within forty-eight hours, Mr. Commissioner," Crandall said flatly, "and the Manties won't be happy to see me at all."</p>
