        Dang! The page you're looking for isn't here.
    </h1>
    <p>
        It looks like you were trying to find <strong><?php echo THISURL; ?></strong>.
        Instead you've gotten our 404 page instead, which stinks.  It could be that the url you typed has some booboos in it.  Have a
        look at it for typos.  Or it could be that the link you clicked is well and truly <s>mangled beyond all hope</s> broken.
    </p>
    <h2>
        So, now what?
    </h2>
    <h3>
        You've got some options:

    <ol>
        <li>
            Please check the URL (address) for spelling, capitalization, and punctuation
            errors.

        <li>
            Wait and try connecting again later.  Get a cup of coffee or something.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stand on one foot, pat the top of your head and shout, “Ooggidy booggidy!”.  Okay, don't do that.  That's just silly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Go to the AQM home page and see if you can get to the page from there.
        </li>
        <li>
            Try one of the menu selections on the left.
